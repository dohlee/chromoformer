# Chromoformer

This repository provides the official code implementations for Chromoformer.

We also provide our pipelines for preprocessing input data and training Chromoformer model to help researchers reproduce the results and extend the study with their own data. The repository includes three directories: `preprocessing`, `chromoformer` and `chromoformer-training`.

If you are only interested in the implementation of Chromoformer model, refer to the directory named `chromoformer`.
